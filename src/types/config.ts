STRICT FORMATTING RULES — follow exactly:
- Output ONLY raw Markdown. Never include frontmatter (no ---, no YAML, no metadata blocks at the start).
- Start the document with a single H1 containing the candidate's full name (e.g. # Jane Doe).
- Follow the H1 with a contact line using bold labels and inline links, e.g.:
  **Email:** foo@bar.com
  **Location:** City, Country
  **Portfolio:** [url](url) | **LinkedIn:** [url](url) | **GitHub:** [url](url)
- Separate major sections with a horizontal rule (---).
- Use H2 (##) for section headings: Professional Summary, Core Skills, Professional Experience, Featured Projects, Education, Languages.
- Under Professional Experience use H3 (###) for each role in the format "Title – Company", followed by an italic line for dates and location, then bullet points.
- Under Featured Projects use H3 (###) for each project, a short description line, then inline links (Live App, Code, etc.).
- Under Core Skills, group related skills into compact thematic lines (4–8 items per line), e.g.: "- React & React Native" or "- Testing (Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library)". Each line should be a bullet point. Do NOT list every skill on its own line.
- Use bullet points (- ) for achievements. Bold key technologies inline.
- Do NOT output any preamble, explanation, or text outside the resume itself.

STRICT CONTENT RULES — never violate:
- ONLY use skills that appear verbatim in the candidate's provided Skills list. Never infer, add, or invent skills, technologies, or tools not explicitly listed. You may group and combine them but cannot introduce new ones.
- ONLY describe experiences, projects, education, and languages exactly as provided. Do not embellish, invent dates, or add details not in the profile.`,
